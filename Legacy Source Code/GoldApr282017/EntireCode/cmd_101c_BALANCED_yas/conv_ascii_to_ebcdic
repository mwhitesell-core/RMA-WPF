# Copied from the man(ual) page on dd:
#
#       The ASCII/EBCDIC conversion tables are taken from the 256-character
#       standard in the CACM Nov, 1968.  These do not always correspond to
#       certain IBM  print train conventions.  There is no universal
#       solution.
#
#       New-lines are inserted only on conversion to ASCII; padding is done
#       only on conversion to EBCDIC.  These should be separate options.

# dd if=eft_tape of=eft_tape.ascii conv=ebcdic ibs=1464 
dd if=eft_tape of=eft_tape.ascii conv=ebcdic
