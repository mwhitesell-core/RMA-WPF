; versions.def
; Purpose: allows applications to determine if they are running
;	   in the normal "live" or "production" system as compared
;	   to one of the other 'special payroll' or 'testing' subsystems
;	   This information is used to blink a warning on the top of the
;	   menu screens to remind the user they are in a "non-normal"
;	   version of the application.
; 
; note: keep versions.ws in sync!
