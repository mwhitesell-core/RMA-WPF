4.3	- move code changes to 101 ********************

5.3	- confirm code changes for r022a into 101 ***********************

19.0	- confirm that recovery programs F001/F002 are ok
20.0	- D705.qks - ???
----    - automatic moh-location calculation rma's location field to access f030
	- DONE
22.0    - yas's upload of web 



changes after rmabill 104
23.0	- newu701/newu706 - add confidentially flag, if flag set then u706
	  should set manual review to "Y" and put description of
		"no confirmation letter to be sent".

24.0 u011	- y2k changes - removed edit of chart nbr against the 
		  patient's birth date.

25.0 rmabill.pdl	- added confidential claim flag to f002_suspend_hdr
26.0 u035c.cbl

     u035c_y2k_layout.cbl - y2k date format removed from u035c.cbl and
			    u035cnoupd to fit format of original pre-printed
			    form.  If new form is generated then
			    u035c_y2k_layout.cbl can be used.
			  - the noupd version of pgm runs u035c without updating
			    the clmhdr and clmdtl again.
27.0 d003.cbl	- updating  pat-date-last-elig-maint with patient's birth
	 	  date rather than system date.

28.0 r087 should use subfile - if needed to be rerun - last mailing date
	of patient is gone (online query ??? )

29.0 unlosoc.qzs	- missing fields (james copied to dyad)
29.0 u030_ohip_rat_tape.fd (u030a/aa1/aa2)
		- remove of y2k kludge (james copied to dyad)
31.0 rmabill.pdl - added new tables f092 and f093
32.0 rmabill.pdl - added entry-time-long and added this field to f087
33.0 d087.qks	 - changed logic substantially
		 - needs removal of '0' before doc-nbr
34.0    - documentation update
	    - doc_dict.awk
		- document the file/record/index names/unique/segments
	    - update E-R diagram based upon above awk script
	    - update f085/f086/f087 processing/integration
            - update flows (u020/u030 corrections as noted)
		(awk of determine?? )
35.0 u011.cbl	- error 32 and 55 confusing - correct
		- confirm if which updates go through and which are ignored
			(may be altered with over night editting)
		- allows an all "blank keyed" record to be added (eg. blank
		  ohip,health nbr and chart (M + blank belongs to VIGLIOMAR
		  and is accepted as ok)
36.0 r085	- ohip submital run - r085 doens't always run automatically
		  and the operator sometimes has to run by hand - investigate
		  under what conditions the jobs doesn't run.
37.0 m020.qks	- re: next available doctor number processing to be kicked out
		  when terminate date set...
38.0		- document wild card/"not" macro to move/delete files

		  and 2nd time into suspense
40.0		- confirm for Thekla how multiple rejection codes on a single
		  claims are processed.        
41.0	u030a.cbl
	u030aa1.cbl
	u030aa2.cbl
		- y2k (MOVE TO HSC !!!)
42.0  d004.cbl (others?)
		- added edits or use $use/costing_billing_codes_?.rtn
		  file to identify valid codes for the "other miscellenous"
		  billing location codes
43.0 accpac	- update AP with y2k patches
44.0 u035	- statements printed for agent 9
		- appear to print wrong name
45.0 u020a.qts	- if claims contains OMA codes K990 thru K997
		  then put hospital number onto ohip tape record
		  regardless of f030 doesn't have a hospital nbr.
		  Use the following logic:
			1st char location code	hospital nbr
			----------------------	-----------
			M			1994
			J			2003
			H			1983
			C			1972
			G			1982
			OTHERWISE default to: 	????(yas to decide)
		Note: suggested approach:
		- u020a.qts - split this pgm into 2 stages putting
		just enough files in the current access statement to
		allow the first pgm to select the appropriate records
		and place them into subfile. Add an 'output add/update' at 
		clmdtl-id[1:11] to tmp-counters-alphaf if the clmhdr-oma-cd
		matches K990-7.  In 2nd stage for each detail link to 
		this tmp file opt and if found override hospital as per
		above logic. (note the procedure that runs this code must
		create empty tmp-counters-alpha befor running u020a.
		NOTE: this logic should also be cloned into the 
		resubmit program that mirrors u020a (r022a ????).
