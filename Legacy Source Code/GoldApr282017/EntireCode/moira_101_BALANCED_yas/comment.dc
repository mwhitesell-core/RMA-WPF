Brad,

In solotest payroll, nothing generated for AFPCON rec-type 'A' because no AFPCON comp code defined in f116 file.

We only create subfile f119_tithe_dtl  
  if    comp-type of f190-comp-codes = "I"        &
    and tithe-in-ex-clude-flag = "I"              &

Also, make sure you have defined TITHE1/2/3 & TITHD1/2/3 & TOTITE/D comp codes in both environments
